from 4 steps of sync its stops on 3 one and told me that there is error -50

after searching a lot on brave apple how to and speaking with customer care i understend that even they cant tell anything regarding this issue.

and i start testings.


main issue was on picture sync. after searching and reading blogs, i find out that iphone/ipad/ipod is not syncing your images but making some CACHE of them and syncing cached files only. and if there is a issue with broken cache file you will always get error on some stage of sync.

problem resolution was quite simple &#8211;  just delete the &#8220;iPod Photo Cache&#8221; directory.

just need to remember to find it in directory of sync.

after connecting device again it will rebuild your image db, and sync will be fine.

btw &#8211; apple recomends to

1. reinstall iTunes.

2. uninstall antivirus

3. uninstall all unnessary programs.

4. 10000 time restart machine
