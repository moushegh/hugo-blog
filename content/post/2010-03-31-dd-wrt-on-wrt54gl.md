tried to install last firmware 24sp2 from 10/10/09 on my Linksys WRT54GL,
  
from start everything looks cool, system get update in 120 second after restart all old config was on place and put back the device to network,
  
from few hours i find out that my cisco 2660 is losing the packages in the network and Sonicwall gateway reporting spoofing attacks.
  
i done like everything that i can, change the switch , sonicwall port, disconnect all employers, but nothing helps. but after removing Linksys everything becomes fine,
  
i change back firmware to 23sp2. for now everything looks cool.
