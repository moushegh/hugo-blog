in case of somebody will have a issues on connecting multifunction all-in-one HP officejet 8500A to Speedport W 723V typ b, all you need to do its to downgrade the firmware from your router, 

old firmware can be downloaded from T-com site. only one that works its 1.11.000 (actual one is 1.24.000) 

spend today 3 hours until found solution , hope somebody who will read this would spend less  <img src="http://i1.wp.com/nazaretyan.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif?w=625" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" data-recalc-dims="1" />
